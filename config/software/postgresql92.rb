  # Postgres 9.2 is our "real" Postgres installation (prior versions

  # with the other binaries used by Private Chef.  This one-liner is
  # probably the easiest way to do that.

  # NOTE: The single-quotes wrapping the inner command are required;
  # otherwise, we end up getting some kind of weird Inception-style
  # variable interpolation, such that the value of $BIN in each
  # iteration of the loop is the last file in the directory.
