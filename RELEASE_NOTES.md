     to members of a particular group. This feature filters based on the memberOf
     attribute and only works with LDAP servers that provide such an attribute.

* `private-chef.rb` and `chef-server.rb`
  * `private-chef.rb`  has been replaced by `chef-server.rb`

  * If you do not have a `private-chef.rb` or `chef-server.rb`, a `chef-server.rb`
    will be created for you at installation.
* LDAP
  * STARTTLS is now properly supported for LDAP.  If your LDAP server supports it
    you can enable it via `ldap['start_tls'] = true` in `/etc/opscode/chef-server.rb`.

    section, below.)

  * `chef-server-ctl` replaces `private-chef-ctl` though
    `private-chef-ctl` will also work in CS12.
  * Several commands added related to the management of users and
    organizations, allowing management of organizations without the management console
    or original webui. You can find information about these commands via `chef-server-ctl help`.
    and looking under "Organization and User Management Commands".  You can find usage
    examples at this location: https://docs.getchef.com/install_server.html
  * new `gather-logs` command to create a tarball of important logs and system information.

  * postgesql slow query logging can now be configured
* Upgrades from Open Source Chef 11.1

    * In addition, three additional chef-server-ctl commands have been added:
      `chef12-upgrade-download`, `chef12-upgrade-data-transform`, and `chef12-upgrade-upload`, which allow
       the upgrade process to be broken down into discrete steps if more control is desired than the upgrade
       command alone provides.
    * Run any of these commands with -h to see the full help menu and all the possible options that can be set.
      In addition, refer to the docs at http://docs.getchef.com/upgrade_server.html#from-chef-server-osc and
      https://docs.getchef.com/upgrade_server_open_source_notes.html#manual-upgrades for more information.

### Security Updates

### API Changes
* `POST` to `/organizations/ORGNAME/groups` now ignores any initial list of users
  and clients provided
* "flavor" header returned from REST API calls is now "cs"
* maximum chef client version is no longer checked

### Organization Policy Changes

*Default Data Bag ACL Change*

Previously, the default permissions of data bags permitted clients
(nodes) to update them, such as during a chef-client run. This has
been modified so that in any new orgs created after this update,
clients will not have write access to data bags.  If you require
the original behavior in organizations created after this update,
you can use the knife acl[1] plugin to add permissions as follows:

    knife acl add containers data update group clients

If you have cookbooks that are creating new data bags, or deleting data
bags, you will also need to add 'create' and 'delete' permissions
respectively:

    knife acl add containers data create group clients
    knife acl add containers data delete group clients

If you want to update your existing organizations to remove
client ability to modify/create/delete new data bags (recommended if you're not
using this currently):

    knife acl remove containers data update group clients
    knife acl remove containers data delete group clients
    knife acl remove containers data create group clients

More information - including examples of modifying permissions for both
newly created data bags and existing data bags data - can be found here:

https://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/11/10/security-update-hosted-chef/

[1] knife-acl is a plugin to support managing ACLs using knife, instead
of the opscode-manage interface. It can be found here: https://github.com/opscode/knife-acl

*Admins Cannot be Removed From Organizations*

A significant number of the support-related issues that we've seen stem
from admins being able to remove themselves from an organization,
particularly when they are the last admin in the organization (but not
necessarily limited to this).

To help prevent this class of troubles, Chef Server now enforces that a
member of an organization's "admins" group cannot be removed from the
organization without first being removed from the "admins" group.

### Deprecations

* The setting ldap['encryption'] is now deprecated. Instead use
  `ldap['ssl_enabled'] = true` or `ldap['tls_enabled'] = true` as appropriate
  to your environment.
