# ASSUMPTIONS
#
# Fresh Install: -------------------------------------------------
#
# There will not be any record of an old data directory.  In this
# case, we should bail out entirely, as there is really nothing to
# upgrade
#
# Existing Install: ----------------------------------------------
#
# There is an old data directory specified, and it is different from
# the new data directory:
#
# If there is an old data directory, then we can safely assume that
# there is a valid Postgres cluster initialized there (since a Chef
# run must have succeeded for us to see any old values.)  If the new
# value for the data directory is the same as the old one, then we
# don't need to do anything, since we are keeping our data directories
# segregated by postgres version.
#
# If the new value is different, however, two things may be happening:
# one, the user may have gone and moved their existing data directory
# somewhere else.  In that case, we should expect to find an existing
# cluster there.  In that case, we'll assume that they know what
# they're doing and not proceed further.
#
# On the other hand, this may be a legitimate upgrade case.  If the
# new directory does not exist, or does exist, but doesn't have an
# initialized cluster, we probably need to update.  Since cluster
# creation and updating are separate steps (and we could conceivably
# fail between them), we're going to drop off a sentinel file that we
# can check to see if we've been migrated.
