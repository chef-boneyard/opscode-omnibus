Private Chef Addons
===================

This directory exists to allow addons to Private Chef to add upstreams and routing rules
to the nginx configuration

Included files
-------------
There are includes in the main Nginx configuration that match the following patterns:

* `*_upstreams.conf`: Upstream definitions

* `*_external.conf`: Routing rules for routes exposed via the external LB

* `*_internal.conf`: Routing rules for routes exposed via the internal LB

File Naming
-----------
Files are included in normal alphabetic ordering.  To ensure consistent ordering, each
addon should use a 2 digit numeric prefix followed by the component name.  e.g for
addon 'foo' we would have files named `10-foo_upstreams.conf`, `10-foo_external.conf`, etc.
